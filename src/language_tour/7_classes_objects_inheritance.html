<h1>Classes, objects and inheritance</h1>
<p>
  ΒScript allows the creation of classes with methods, initializers, and single inheritance. Classes are created using
  the 'class' keyword followed by the class name, and then a block. This block may contain method declarations, which
  are like routine declarations but don't require the keyword (the 'self' paramenter is implicit). In methods, it is
  possible to access the object's fields using 'self'. initializers are declared as methods with the same name as the
  class, and calling the class name will call the initializer, which returns a new instance of the class.
</p>

<p>
  ΒScript only supports single inheritance, and it is done by declaring the class with the following sintax:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="class (class name) < (superclass name) {(class declaration)}"></p>
<p>
  superclass methods can be called using the "super" keyword. A class can only have one initializer, and they are not
  inherited.
</p>
<p>
  The following code sample exemplifies pretty much everything explained here:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code='class A {$method() {$print "a method"$}$}$$class B < A {$method() {$print "B method"$}$$test() {$super.method()$}$}$$class C < B {$C(callback) {$this.callback = callback$}$$callCallback() {$this.callback()$}$}$$function printStuff() {$print "stu" + "ff"$}$$var thing = C(printStuff)$$thing.test()$thing.method()$thing.callCallback()'></p>
