<h1>Sets</h1>

<p>
  ΒScript also allows users to define real sets. More specifically, intervals, roster sets, sets defined as solutions to
  equations, and sets derived from operations between the three former types. It is also able to compare sets for being
  disjoined with or contained in another, or to check if a particular number belongs to the set.
</p>

<h2>Set definitions</h2>
<p>All set definitions can have the <span class="code_fragment">set</span> keyword before them, but it is
  completely optional. </p>

<h3>Interval definitions</h3>
<p>To define an interval, do exactly as you would when writing an interval! <span class="code_fragment">(</span> is a open
  left edge, and <span class="code_fragment">)</span> is a open right edge. <span class="code_fragment">[</span> is a closed
  left edge, and <span class="code_fragment">]</span> is a closed right edge. Separate the value of left and right edge
  with a comma. Note that <span class="code_fragment">infinity</span> is a valid edge.
</p>

<p class="code_block" code='$let A = set (10, 20];$let f(x) = 256^x;$let B = [f(0), f(1)); '></p>

<h3>Roster set definitions</h3>
<p>Roster set is a fancy name for "set defined by listing all its members". In order to define them, put the elements in
  braces separated by commas. </p>

<p class="code_block" code='let A = {10, 20, 30, 0, -127, pi, 318};'></p>

<h3>Builder set definitions</h3>

<p>
  builder sets are sets defined as solutions to equations or equations systems. When betascript is sure that it can
  find all solutions to a equation, it will return another type of set instead of a proper builder set. For
  now, this only happens for linear equations. In order to declare them, between braces, put a optional list of
  parameters (which works exactly like the function declaration parameters, it defines the Variables and checks that
  they actually contain Variables when already defined), a <span class="code_fragment">|</span>, them a
  equation or inequation (two functions to each side of ==, &lt;, &gt;, &le; or &ge;):
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace">
  print {x| x > 5} //prints (5,∞)
  print {|x == 2} //prints { 2 }. Notice that we don't need to specify x because it was declared as a parameter in the
  previous line, but the '|' is always obligatory
</p>

<h3>Empty set</h3>
<p>the empty set is the set without any elements. it can be used in betascript as <span
    class="code_fragment">emptySet</span>, <span class="code_fragment">∅</span> empty braces (<span
    class="code_fragment">{}</span>) or intervals with open edges where the edges are equal (anything of the
  form <span class="code_fragment">(a, a)</span>,<span class="code_fragment"></span>[a, a)</span> or <span
    class="code_fragment"></span>(a, a]</span>). It has the property of being the third value that is evaluated as false,
  together with <span class="code_fragment">nil</span>, <span class="code_fragment">unknown</span> and <span
    class="code_fragment">false</span>.
</p>

<h2>Set operations</h2>

<p>betascript supports unions, complements, relative complements and absolute complements as operations that return
  sets, and it is able to check if two sets are disjoined, if one is contained in the other, or if a number belongs to a
  set. The "no false positives premise" applies here too. When it isn't able to compute one of the first operations to a
  Interval, Roster Set or Builder Set, it returns a composite set that works just like any other. Every operation has at
  least a keyword, operator or unicode operator associated with it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Union has '<span class="code_fragment">union</span>', '<span class="code_fragment">∪</span>' and
    '<span class="code_fragment">+</span>';
  </li>
  <li>
    Intersection has '<span class="code_fragment">intersection</span>', '<span class="code_fragment">∩</span>' and '
    <spanclass="code_fragment">*</span>';
  </li>
  <li>
    relative complement has '<span class="code_fragment">-</span>', '<span class="code_fragment">/</span>' and '<span
      class="code_fragment">\</span>';
  </li>
  <li>contained in has '<span class="code_fragment">contained</span>' and '<span class="code_fragment">⊂</span>'
  </li>
  <li>belongs to in has '<span class="code_fragment">belongs</span>' and '<span class="code_fragment">∈</span>'
  </li>
  <li>
    absolute complement has '<span class="code_fragment">'</span>;
  </li>
  <li>
    disjoined has '<span class="code_fragment">disjoined</span>';
  </li>

</ul>
