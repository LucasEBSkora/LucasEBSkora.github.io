<h1>Routines</h1>
<p>
  Î’Script has routines as first class citizens, and creates them in the lexical scope. In order to declare one, use the
  keyword "routine" followed by its name, parentheses containing a list of parameters, and a block body:
</p>

<p class="code_block" code='routine printStuff() {$print "stu" + "ff"$}'></p>

<p>
  This means things like the block below are possible:
</p>

<p class="code_block" code="routine makeCounter() {$var a = 0$$routine count () {$a = a + 1$return a$}$$return count$}$$var counter = makeCounter()$print counter()$print counter()$$var counter2 = makeCounter()$print counter2()"></p>
<p> with output:</p>

<p class="code_block" code="1$2$1"></p>

<p>
  Oh! And the return keyword works just like print: it expects the whole expression to be in the same line. if it isn't,
  the last part of the line needs to be an operator to indicate that it isn't over.
