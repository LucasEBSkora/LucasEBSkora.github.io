<h1>Comments</h1>
<p>
  Î’Script supports four types of comments, two of them classic, and two original creations.
</p>

<h3>Line comments:</h3>

<p>
  Begins with "//". comments out all the code after // until the next linebreak.
</p>

<p class="code_block">
  <!-- //print "this won't print";
  print "this will"; //print "but this won't";
  print "this will be fine"; -->
  <span class="comment">//print "this won't print";</span> <br>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="stringLiteral">"this will"</span>; <span class="comment">//print "but this won't";</span> <br>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="stringLiteral">"this will be fine"</span>; 
</p>

<h3>Multiline comments:</h3>

<p>begins with a "/*", ends with "*/". Comments everything in between.</p>

<p class="code_block">
  <!-- /*
  this
  is
  a
  multiline
  comment
  */ -->
  <span class="comment">/*<br>
    this<br>
    is<br>
    a<br>
    multiline<br>
    comment<br>
  */</span> 
</p>

<h3>Name comments:</h3>

<p>begins with a "@" sign. Comments everything until the next whitespace, be it space, linebreak or tab.</p>

<p class="code_block">
  <!-- print @this-is-a-name-comment-so-this-won't-print "but this will, because whitespace terminates them" -->
  <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="comment">@this-is-a-name-comment-so-this-won't-print</span> <span class="stringLiteral">"but this will, because whitespace terminates them"</span> 
</p>

<h3>Directives:</h3>

<p>
  uses the "#" sign. In most cases, does exactly the same thing as the name comment, with the difference it can be used
  to set some interpreter flags, e.g. '#bs_tt_interpret' will make the interpreter go into twitter bot mode, which
  prohibits loops and routines and class definitions. Currently, this is the only directive which is defined, and there
  really isn't any reason to use it outside of twitter.
