<h1>Comments</h1>
<p>
  Î’Script supports four types of comments, two of them classic, and two original creations.
</p>

<h3>Line comments:</h3>

<p>
  Begins with "//". comments out all the code after // until the next linebreak.
</p>

<p class="code_block" code='//print "this will not print";$print "this will"; //print "but this will not";$print "this will be fine";'></p>

<h3>Multiline comments:</h3>

<p>begins with a "/*", ends with "*/". Comments everything in between.</p>

<p class="code_block" code="/*$this$is$a$multiline$comment$*/"></p>

<h3>Name comments:</h3>

<p>begins with a "@" sign. Comments everything until the next whitespace, be it space, linebreak or tab.</p>

<p class="code_block" code='print @this-is-a-name-comment-so-this-wont-print "but this will, because whitespace terminates them"'></p>

<h3>Directives:</h3>

<p>
  uses the "#" sign. In most cases, does exactly the same thing as the name comment, with the difference it can be used
  to set some interpreter flags, e.g. '#bs_tt_interpret' will make the interpreter go into twitter bot mode, which
  prohibits loops and routines and class definitions. Currently, this is the only directive which is defined, and there
  really isn't any reason to use it outside of twitter.
