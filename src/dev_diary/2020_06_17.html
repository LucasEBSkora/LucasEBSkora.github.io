<h1>Language Tour - 17/06/2020</h1>
<p>In the previous entry, I said I would start writing the language documentation before progressing with development.
</p>

<p>I immediatelly noticed that was a bad idea. First, I don't even have the knowledge required to do it, and second,
  doing all this setup to keep programming is taking a slight effect on my motivation to continue this project. Yes, if
  the language takes off in any way I have to do it, and i would definately learn a lot doing it. However, it's not what
  I want to be learning <b>right now</b>. Therefore, I changed the name of the "documentation" section to "language
  tour", and in it I will simply explain the basics of what the language is capable of. After all, the chance someone
  decides to learn this language before learning others that also have dynamic typing, if/else blocks, while and for
  loops, etc. is virtually zero.
