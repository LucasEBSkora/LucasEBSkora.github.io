<h1>Hello World! - 11/06/2020</h1>
<p>
  This is the first entry in the dev diaries, and so I'd like to establish some things about this project:
<ol>
  <li>As you can see by the quality of this page, I'm not very experienced with web developing;</li>
  <li>I do it for fun/learning, so I can't guarantee it will have very frequent updates;</li>
  <li>I'll do my best writing documentation, but I never really did it before so it might be a little weird;</li>
  <li>dd/mm/yyyy > mm.dd.yyyy by a long run</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
  And now for stuff actually about the project: as it currently stands, there is a bunch of dart classes to represent
  functions which can be represented by compositions, sums, subtractions, multiplications, divisions and exponentiations
  of logarithms, constant, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, inverse hyperbolic, absolute value and sign
  functions; and an interpreter of a language which is basically a very poor subset of javascript with a few different
  keywords. The "middle-term" objective of this project is to implement a language capable of creating and operating
  with these functions, as well as determining their natural domain, codomain and range, and solving equations involving
  such functions (in the form f(x) = g(x))
</p>
<p>
  In order to do this, we (I) must first change the way functions can be evaluated. (As of this entry, 'function" will
  refer to values of this data type, and "routines" will be used to represent what in other programming languages is
  refered to as a function, as explained in the language tour). As of now, they can only be evaluated by passing as
  argument a map containing as keys the name of every variable, and as values the values of these variables. <br>E.g.,
  <span class="code_fragment">f(x,y,z)</span> can be evaluated with the vector <span class="code_fragment">(1,2,
    3)</span> by calling <span class="code_fragment">f({x : 1,y : 2, z : 3})</span>. I want for it to be possible to
  evaluate these functions by simply passing <span class="code_fragment">f(1,2,3)</span>. For that, we must implement a
  few things: first, we must know the set of variables in which a function is defined, which is already done in the
  "parameters" getter. Then, we must define a method which takes a list of doubles and assigns them to this map. For us
  to know what position in this list corresponds to which variable, we will make it so that they are evaluated in
  lexicographical order.
</p>
<p>
  We must also write the documentation for the language. I feel the best way to make sure it is as complete as possible
  is by writing the full documentation from the beggining and changing it as soon as anything new is implemented. This
  does, however, mean that we will write a very useless documentation to start with. That is it for this first entry, I
  hope to have new things to write about soon!
