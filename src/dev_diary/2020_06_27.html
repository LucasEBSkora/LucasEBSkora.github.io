<h1>Got to the bridge, can't avoid crossing it anymore - 27/06/2020</h1>
<p> Well, everything I needed to do before actually implementing the functions into the language is ready. By the way, I
  ended up changing to using negatives as a class, because I noticed there was a good way of dealing with other function
  attributes (namely, parameters, and in a later date domain and codomain) which wouldn't apply to negatives. So, now I
  have to actually discuss how they will work. In order to declare a function, one does something like:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="let f(x, y, z) = sin(x) + cos(y) + z^3;"></p>
<p>
  Where 'let' is the keyword to declare variables, f is the variable name, and (x, y, z) is the optional parameter list.
  This list is used in case the user wants to defined a function with extra variables that aren't actually necessary
  (such as f(x) = 0) or to evaluate them in a order other than alphabetic. e.g., if I wanted z to be the first
  parameter, I would be able to declare the function f(z, y, x). If I wanted to call this function, i could use an
  expression such as:
</p>

<p class="code_block" code="print f(2, 10, cos(z));"></p>
<p>
  outputting:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="sin(2) + cos(10) + cos(z)^3"></p>
<p>
  Which is not necessarily what you expected. ΒScript keeps things exact if you don't explicity state you want
  approximations done, through the approximate (~) operator:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="print ~f(2, 10, cos(3));"></p>
<p>
  outputting:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="-0.90005104017"></p>
<p>
  ΒScript is also capable of calculating partial derivatives. For that, use the del() / del() operator. As your teacher
  probably told you in calculus class, this isn't a real division, it's a notation (until he told you it actually was a
  division of differentials, and, just like in calculus class, we might have differentials later):
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="print del(f)/del(x);"></p>
<p>
  outputs:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="cos(x)"></p>
<p>
  Partial derivatives and higher-order derivatives are also supported:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="let f = x^2*y^3;$print del(f)/del(x, y, x);"></p>
<p>
  outputs:
</p>
<p class="code_block" code="6*y^2"></p>
<p>
  When all of these things are implemented, ΒScript V0.1 will be ready! as minor things, I'll change the keywords "var"
  to "let" and "function" to "routine".
