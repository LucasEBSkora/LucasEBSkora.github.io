<h1>Calling functions - 19/06/2020</h1>
<p>In the first entry, I mentioned it would be necessary to change how we evaluate functions in order to continue
  developing the language.</p>
<p>
  For this, a few changes are still necessary. Currently, I am changing the way functions are evaluated. Before,
  evaluating a function would be done by passing a Map &lt; String, double &gt;, but since ΒScript doesn't even have the
  type double, that doesn't make any sense. therefore, we now evaluate them by passing a Map &lt; String, BSFunction
  &gt;, which has a second benefit: we know can do function composition properly! Before, things like
</p>
<p class="code_block">
  <!-- f = sin(x)
  g = f(x^2) -->
  <span class="identifier">f</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>); <br>
<span class="identifier">g</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">f</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span> <span class="operator">^</span> <span class="numericLiteral">2</span>); 
</p>
<p>
  wouldn't work. now, that's perfectly valid! Besides, calling a function like that will not perform simplifications. if
  we had, for example
</p>
<p class="code_block">
  <!-- f = sin(x)
  g = f(2) -->
  <span class="identifier">f</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>) <br>
  <span class="identifier">g</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">f</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">2</span>) 
</p>
<p>
  <span class="code_fragmnent">g</span> would evaluate to <span class="code_fragmnent">sin(2)</span>, not to
  0.909...<br>
  if we wanted it to evaluate to its approximation, we can use the approx getter, which, in the language, will translate
  to the <span class="code_fragmnent">~</span> operator.In ΒScript, one would write:
</p>
<p class="code_block">
  <!-- g = ~sin(2) -->
  <span class="identifier">g</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="operator">~</span><span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">2</span>)
</p>
<p>
  to get 0.909...
