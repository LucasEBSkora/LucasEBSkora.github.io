<h1> Unmessing up optional semicolons - 31/10/2020 </h1>
<p>
  the way optional semicolons was implemented was that "if you don't want to put one, a linebreak is fine". This is
  horrible. Don't do this. In all the places linebreaks were allowed in the middle of an expression, i had to check and
  remove them by hand. This happens because to check for meaningless linebreaks in the scanner, i could only look back,
  since the next token wasn't scanned yet. To solve this, i decided to add an extra function in the end of the scanner
  which looks at the token list to check for linebreaks where the next token automatically discards the linebreak, such
  as <span class="code_fragment">)</span>, <span class="code_fragment">]</span>, <span class="code_fragment">}</span> and <span class="code_fragment">else</span>.
