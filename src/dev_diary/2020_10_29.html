<h1> ΒScript V0.2: "Setting up" - 29/10/2020 </h1>
<p>
  After almost three months in the making, ΒScript V0.2 is finally done! It now supports real set definitions and
  operations, optional semicolons, a few new keywords and operators, among other things. I am very happy to have
  finished it, but the show must go on! First of all, I want to share some of my conclusions regarding the update: it is
  very unstable and badly written. As I said, optional semicolons are hard, and messing with them broke a lot of things
  and really tanked parsing speed. It needs to be redone, preferentially in a way that is dealed with completely in the
  scanner. Besides, the "operation tables" for set operations weren't as good as I thought. In another note, I noticed
  that as I extend the functionalities of functions and sets, their classes will become more and more complicated, and
  adding new operations will become very hard. It also makes it completely impossible for the users of the language to
  add new functionalities, which is <i>prohibitively bad</i>. A programming language can't stand if users can't develop
  libraries, and for two of the 5 base data types to be complex but closed is inacceptable.
</p>
<p>
  With these things in mind, I would like to propose part of what will be ΒScript V0.3: a refactoring of the data type
  classes using the Visitor design pattern and/or a modification of it, a rewrite of the grammar to avoid linebreak
  tokens as much as possible and actually use Backus-Naur Form. But these things aren't really new funtionalities, it is
  just "backend" stuff. What will actually be new in 0.3? first, tri-state logic. I've realized that True and False
  aren't enough, because ΒScript sometimes won't know how to evaluate something exactly. For those things, it is better
  to have a "unsure" or "unknown" value, to replace the "better false negatives than false positives" policy. True will
  mean absolutely true and false absolutely false. Unsure means unsure, and, for a while, a lot of things will return
  it. Some will probably keep returning it forever.
</p>

<p>
  But tri-state logic isn't what 0.3 is mainly about. The update will be called "The Unicode Update", because it will
  include a lot of unicode alternatives for operands. No more "union", "intersection", "===". We will use ∪, ∩ and ≡.
  See, I think programming has more to do with aesthetics than some would be inclined to believe, and making sure
  ΒScript is pretty is very important to me. I think allowing unicode operators when they exist is good for readability
  and to make ΒScript look more like math, which is kind of the point. Of course, I don't expect people to have these
  symbols on their keyboards, so I will also write a formatter for ΒScript which automatically does these replacements.
  It will also help enforce the formatting rules which i'd like people to follow that won't be possible when the
  linebreak tokens are removed. And talking about aesthetics, I will redo the website, because it is just too ugly.
