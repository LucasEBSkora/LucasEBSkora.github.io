    <section id="contents"><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Hello World! - 11/06/2020</h1>
<p>
  This is the first entry in the dev diaries, and so I'd like to establish some things about this project:
</p><ol>
  <li>As you can see by the quality of this page, I'm not very experienced with web developing;</li>
  <li>I do it for fun/learning, so I can't guarantee it will have very frequent updates;</li>
  <li>I'll do my best writing documentation, but I never really did it before so it might be a little weird;</li>
  <li>dd/mm/yyyy &gt; mm.dd.yyyy by a long run</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
  And now for stuff actually about the project: as it currently stands, there is a bunch of dart classes to represent
  functions which can be represented by compositions, sums, subtractions, multiplications, divisions and exponentiations
  of logarithms, constant, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, inverse hyperbolic, absolute value and sign
  functions; and an interpreter of a language which is basically a very poor subset of javascript with a few different
  keywords. The "middle-term" objective of this project is to implement a language capable of creating and operating
  with these functions, as well as determining their natural domain, codomain and range, and solving equations involving
  such functions (in the form f(x) = g(x))
</p>
<p>
  In order to do this, we (I) must first change the way functions can be evaluated. (As of this entry, 'function" will
  refer to values of this data type, and "routines" will be used to represent what in other programming languages is
  refered to as a function, as explained in the language tour). As of now, they can only be evaluated by passing as
  argument a map containing as keys the name of every variable, and as values the values of these variables. <br>E.g.,
  <span class="code_fragment">f(x,y,z)</span> can be evaluated with the vector <span class="code_fragment">(1,2,
    3)</span> by calling <span class="code_fragment">f({x : 1,y : 2, z : 3})</span>. I want for it to be possible to
  evaluate these functions by simply passing <span class="code_fragment">f(1,2,3)</span>. For that, we must implement a
  few things: first, we must know the set of variables in which a function is defined, which is already done in the
  "parameters" getter. Then, we must define a method which takes a list of doubles and assigns them to this map. For us
  to know what position in this list corresponds to which variable, we will make it so that they are evaluated in
  lexicographical order.
</p>
<p>
  We must also write the documentation for the language. I feel the best way to make sure it is as complete as possible
  is by writing the full documentation from the beggining and changing it as soon as anything new is implemented. This
  does, however, mean that we will write a very useless documentation to start with. That is it for this first entry, I
  hope to have new things to write about soon!
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Language Tour - 17/06/2020</h1>
<p>In the previous entry, I said I would start writing the language documentation before progressing with development.
</p>

<p>I immediatelly noticed that was a bad idea. First, I don't even have the knowledge required to do it, and second,
  doing all this setup to keep programming is taking a slight effect on my motivation to continue this project. Yes, if
  the language takes off in any way I have to do it, and i would definately learn a lot doing it. However, it's not what
  I want to be learning <b>right now</b>. Therefore, I changed the name of the "documentation" section to "language
  tour", and in it I will simply explain the basics of what the language is capable of. After all, the chance someone
  decides to learn this language before learning others that also have dynamic typing, if/else blocks, while and for
  loops, etc. is virtually zero.
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Calling functions - 19/06/2020</h1>
<p>In the first entry, I mentioned it would be necessary to change how we evaluate functions in order to continue
  developing the language.</p>
<p>
  For this, a few changes are still necessary. Currently, I am changing the way functions are evaluated. Before,
  evaluating a function would be done by passing a Map &lt; String, double &gt;, but since ΒScript doesn't even have the
  type double, that doesn't make any sense. therefore, we now evaluate them by passing a Map &lt; String, BSFunction
  &gt;, which has a second benefit: we know can do function composition properly! Before, things like
</p>
<p id="test" class="code_block"><span class="identifier">f</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>) <br>
<span class="identifier">g</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">f</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span> <span class="operator">^</span> <span class="numericLiteral">2</span>) 
</p>
<p>
  wouldn't work. now, that's perfectly valid! Besides, calling a function like that will not perform simplifications. if
  we had, for example
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="identifier">f</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>) <br>
<span class="identifier">g</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">f</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">2</span>) 
</p>
<p>
  <span class="code_fragmnent">g</span> would evaluate to <span class="code_fragmnent">sin(2)</span>, not to
  0.909...<br>
  if we wanted it to evaluate to its approximation, we can use the approx getter, which, in the language, will translate
  to the <span class="code_fragmnent">~</span> operator.In ΒScript, one would write:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="identifier">g</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="operator">~</span><span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">2</span>) 
</p>
<p>
  to get 0.909...
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Calling functions pt.2 - 20/06/2020</h1>
<p>
  While implementing what I described in the previous entry, I noticed an easy way to solve a few problems I was
  thinking about. Since now function composition is now properly possible, we can create new functions differently.
  Before, we created them by calling factory functions external to the class, which means, there is a 'Sin' class with
  only a private constructor, and a public function "sin" which returns BSFunction objects. This works fine for the Dart
  classes, but is a little annoying for the language because there wouldn't be "default" objects for each function. If,
  say, we wanted to determine the domain of the sine function, we would have to do something like:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="identifier">f</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>) <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>); <br>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="identifier">domain</span>(<span class="identifier">f</span>); 
</p>
<p>
  But if we had default functions, simply calling <span class="code_fragment">print domain(sin)</span> would work! By
  the way, I'm sorry if all of this sounds like a poorly explained ramble about implementation details, but that is
  exactly what these dev diaries are going to be.

<h1>Why is multiplying by -1 so hard? - 20/06/2020</h1>
<p>
  Since the first iteration of this project, one of the hardest problems I had to solve was how to handle stuff being
  multiplied by -1. There were basically three different solutions I thought about for this problem, all of them good in
  some ways, and really annoying in others;
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <b>Use normal multiplications:</b> basically, use the multiplication class to handle it, and have some special
    clause in the multiplication printing where if the first element in the array of operands is a -1, print only a '-'
    instead of a '-1*'. This way is good because it is closer to how it normally works in maths, but would make an
    already large and complicated class (Multiplication) even worse, and identifying when things in a sum can be
    simplified would be even worse.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use a 'negative' field</b>: the currently used solution. Basically, every BSFunction has a boolean 'negative'
    field, and when printing, if this field is positive, it puts a '-' before of the rest. However, this approach
    creates a lot of hassle when creating new functions from other ones, and led to the creation of like, 6 different
    getters which really have no other use. In the way it's done, it's also problematic because if I forget to specify
    the sign of something, it is positive, leading to evaluations and functions normally having bugs related to sign and
    also a lot of code repetition.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use a Negative class</b>: In a way, midway between the two previous solutions: wrap functions multiplied by -1 in
    a Negative object. It has many of the benefits of the first solution, but without polluting other classes, and also
    doesn't have the problems related to having to always deal with sign by hand. It does, sadly, still have the problem
    of making it a little harder to check for simplifications.
  </li>
</ul>
All of them have some benefits and some problems. I can't really think of another way of doing this that wouldn't have
some of these. Anyway, i'm consering changing over to the third solution, because the second one does make the program
harder to read and mantain. It might come back to haunt me in the long run, but it will clean up the code in many of the
files. I'm afraid it might be bad for performance, since extra objects for each '-' is a lot worse than having to deal
with a field. Maybe i should try to figure out a more organic way to deal with the negatives instead of rebuilding the
system from the ground up.
<p></p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Got to the bridge, can't avoid crossing it anymore - 27/06/2020</h1>
<p> Well, everything I needed to do before actually implementing the functions into the language is ready. By the way, I
  ended up changing to using negatives as a class, because I noticed there was a good way of dealing with other function
  attributes (namely, parameters, and in a later date domain and codomain) which wouldn't apply to negatives. So, now I
  have to actually discuss how they will work. In order to declare a function, one does something like:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="identifier">f</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>, <span class="identifier">y</span>, <span class="identifier">z</span>) <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>) <span class="operator">+</span> <span class="identifier">cos</span>(<span class="identifier">y</span>) <span class="operator">+</span> <span class="identifier">z</span> <span class="operator">^</span> <span class="numericLiteral">3</span>; 
</p>
<p>
  Where 'let' is the keyword to declare variables, f is the variable name, and (x, y, z) is the optional parameter list.
  This list is used in case the user wants to defined a function with extra variables that aren't actually necessary
  (such as f(x) = 0) or to evaluate them in a order other than alphabetic. e.g., if I wanted z to be the first
  parameter, I would be able to declare the function f(z, y, x). If I wanted to call this function, i could use an
  expression such as:
</p>

<p class="code_block"><span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="identifier">f</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">2</span>, <span class="numericLiteral">10</span>, <span class="identifier">cos</span>(<span class="identifier">z</span>)); 
</p>
<p>
  outputting:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="identifier">sin</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">2</span>) <span class="operator">+</span> <span class="identifier">cos</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">10</span>) <span class="operator">+</span> <span class="identifier">cos</span>(<span class="identifier">z</span>) <span class="operator">^</span> <span class="numericLiteral">3</span> 
</p>
<p>
  Which is not necessarily what you expected. ΒScript keeps things exact if you don't explicity state you want
  approximations done, through the approximate (~) operator:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="operator">~</span><span class="identifier">f</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">2</span>, <span class="numericLiteral">10</span>, <span class="identifier">cos</span>(<span class="numericLiteral">3</span>)); 
</p>
<p>
  outputting:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="operator">-</span><span class="numericLiteral">0.90005104017</span> 
</p>
<p>
  ΒScript is also capable of calculating partial derivatives. For that, use the del() / del() operator. As your teacher
  probably told you in calculus class, this isn't a real division, it's a notation (until he told you it actually was a
  division of differentials, and, just like in calculus class, we might have differentials later):
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="operator">del</span>(<span class="identifier">f</span>) <span class="operator">/</span> <span class="operator">del</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>); 
</p>
<p>
  outputs:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="identifier">cos</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>) 
</p>
<p>
  Partial derivatives and higher-order derivatives are also supported:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="identifier">f</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="identifier">x</span> <span class="operator">^</span> <span class="numericLiteral">2</span> <span class="operator">*</span> <span class="identifier">y</span> <span class="operator">^</span> <span class="numericLiteral">3</span>; <br>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="operator">del</span>(<span class="identifier">f</span>) <span class="operator">/</span> <span class="operator">del</span>(<span class="identifier">x</span>, <span class="identifier">y</span>, <span class="identifier">x</span>); 
</p>
<p>
  outputs:
</p>
<p class="code_block"><span class="numericLiteral">6</span> <span class="operator">*</span> <span class="identifier">y</span> <span class="operator">^</span> <span class="numericLiteral">2</span> 
</p>
<p>
  When all of these things are implemented, ΒScript V0.1 will be ready! as minor things, I'll change the keywords "var"
  to "let" and "function" to "routine".
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Launch day! - 29/06/2020</h1>
<p>
  ΒScript version 0.1 is ready! It has a million bugs and not even half of what I want it to be able to do, but now it
  at least lives up to it's proposal: One can create functions in it! I won't explain everything here, because that goes
  into the language tour, but it is alreaady pretty exciting. For more information about it, go there!
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Road to 0.2 - 30/06/2020</h1>
<p>Yesterday I finished v0.1, but that doesn't mean I'll take a break! I'm thinking about what I want to call ΒScript
  v0.2. The primary focus now will be to develop the things I feel will be necessary for making the twitter version of
  ΒScript (yes, thats a thing). Basically a bot which will answer to tweets with ΒScript code with their output. For
  that, I will turn off defining and using routines and loops (don't want anyone killing my bot with a while(true)).
  Other than that, I want to try to make error handling better, since I already noticed it doesn't show some of them
  properly. As for actual new features, I'm planning the creation of "comparison expressions", which are basically
  equations and inequalities, and the ability to create subsets of R, which will come in handy with later updates.
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Set operations are also (kinda) hard - 04/07/2020 </h1>
<p>I started to define set classes to represent subsets of R. This wil have many uses in future updates, so I want to do
  it well. Since I want to be able to define many types of sets, I decided that there will be a few different subtypes:
</p><ul>
  <li>Intervals, as in, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)">intervals</a>.</li>
  <li>Roster sets, which are created by enumerating their elements, e.g. {1, 10, 52.3, -17}</li>
  <li>Set builders, which are defined by solutions of comparisons, e.g., {x | x == 10 and sin(x) &gt; 10}</li>
  <li>Disjoined unions of sets, which are used when something has parts which can't be simplified to one of the
    previous.
    e.g., the union of [-1,0] and [1, 2] is still [-1,0] U [1,2]. In other cases, however, simplifications can be made:
    [-1,0] U {-1, -0.3, 57} = [-1,0] U {57}
  </li>
  <li>the empty set, which is considered a different class because operations with empty sets are normally very
    straightforward.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
  Up to this point, everything is fine. The problem is trying to define operations between sets. we need to define how
  to do unions, intersections and complements between all of the above types. This is not such a big problem for
  complement: we can just have a complement method which itselfs check what is the type of the other Set in order to
  properly compute it. A bigger problem comes from unions and intersections: they are comutative! That means that using
  the tactic above will lead to a lot of hassle. Essentially, for all 3 operations, we need to fill out the following
  table:
</p><table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Interval</th>
      <th>Roster</th>
      <th>Builder</th>
      <th>Disjoint Union</th>
      <th>Empty</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Interval</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Roster</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Builder</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Disjoint Union</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Empty</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p></p>

<p>
  However, there's a catch. Unions and intersections are commutative, which means the table is simetric. I don't have to
  fill it all the way, The upper triangular part is enough. With all that taken into account, i need to think of a data
  structure to represent these "operation tables" that won't be too hard to extend later...
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1>Optional semicolons: why would i do this to myself? - 15/07/2020 </h1>
<p>
  In Brazil, we have a saying: "Não se mexe em time que está vencendo", which has the same meaning as "If it ain't
  broke, don't fix it", but brazilian and soccer-y. Anyway, I'm about to start fixing the not-broken thing: I want to
  make semicolons optional, if not completely unnecessary, for ΒScript. Why? because I want the language to be written
  as closely as possible to actual maths, and we don't use semicolons for that in math. This will, of course, create a
  million problems, but that's the whole point of this entire language: making me think about problems which I can
  actually solve, unlike, you know, the dumpster fire that the world currently is.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, my approach to this is going to be similar to python's (according to <a href="http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html#design-note">Crafting Interpreters</a>, by Bob Nystrom, the
  book the language was based on) approach: A line end is going to be interpreted as meaningful, except when the
  previous token always needs something to follow it (unlike python, which uses the explicit \ to do so). This list of
  tokens would basically be every operator, '('', '['', '{', ',' and '.'. This of course means a bunch of things would
  become invalid, but most of them are ugly, so I don't care. When 0.2 is done, I'll write about what this new set of
  rules means in the language tour, mainly because I haven't thought about the consequences yet.
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1> My beautiful baby boy - 21/08/2020</h1>
<p>
  Today was one of the first days I could actually use my comparison class to solve something. It was very simple, but
  just seeing a program I created be able to transform an inequation into a solution set was something amazing to feel.
  The first time I was able to see the output of <span class="code_fragment">print del(sin) / del(x);</span>
  was definitely the best day of the year; and today wasn't so good, but automating set operations made it a little
  better.
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1> Everything is a tree - 29/08/2020</h1>
<p>
  Everything in ΒScript is a tree. The interpreter works by traversing trees, functions are trees, logic expressions are
  trees. Trees within trees within trees. I tried implementing at least sets to not be trees, but even that failed. I
  thought I would be able to always evaluate a set operation to a exact set (represent A union B as C instead of A union
  B). I almost did, but at the very last case I thought of, I noticed it would be impossible. The intersection of an
  Interval (something in the form a &lt; x &lt; b) and a builder set (something in the form {x | f(x) = g(x)}) can only be
  exactly evaluated if we know every solution of f(x) = g(x) in the interval (a, b). Considering f and g are supposed to
  be literally any differentiable function, that is impossible. Therefore, I'll have to create another set type to
  represent intersections of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions#Intensional_definition">intensionally-defined</a>
  sets. The same will apply to relative complements of intensional sets. With that, I'll be forced to represent sets
  defined in terms of operations involving intensionally-defined sets as trees.
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1> ΒScript V0.2: "Setting up" - 29/10/2020 </h1>
<p>
  After almost three months in the making, ΒScript V0.2 is finally done! It now supports real set definitions and
  operations, optional semicolons, a few new keywords and operators, among other things. I am very happy to have
  finished it, but the show must go on! First of all, I want to share some of my conclusions regarding the update: it is
  very unstable and badly written. As I said, optional semicolons are hard, and messing with them broke a lot of things
  and really tanked parsing speed. It needs to be redone, preferentially in a way that is dealed with completely in the
  scanner. Besides, the "operation tables" for set operations weren't as good as I thought. In another note, I noticed
  that as I extend the functionalities of functions and sets, their classes will become more and more complicated, and
  adding new operations will become very hard. It also makes it completely impossible for the users of the language to
  add new functionalities, which is <i>prohibitively bad</i>. A programming language can't stand if users can't develop
  libraries, and for two of the 5 base data types to be complex but closed is inacceptable.
</p>
<p>
  With these things in mind, I would like to propose part of what will be ΒScript V0.3: a refactoring of the data type
  classes using the Visitor design pattern and/or a modification of it, a rewrite of the grammar to avoid linebreak
  tokens as much as possible and actually use Backus-Naur Form. But these things aren't really new funtionalities, it is
  just "backend" stuff. What will actually be new in 0.3? first, tri-state logic. I've realized that True and False
  aren't enough, because ΒScript sometimes won't know how to evaluate something exactly. For those things, it is better
  to have a "unsure" or "unknown" value, to replace the "better false negatives than false positives" policy. True will
  mean absolutely true and false absolutely false. Unsure means unsure, and, for a while, a lot of things will return
  it. Some will probably keep returning it forever.
</p>

<p>
  But tri-state logic isn't what 0.3 is mainly about. The update will be called "The Unicode Update", because it will
  include a lot of unicode alternatives for operands. No more "union", "intersection", "===". We will use ∪, ∩ and ≡.
  See, I think programming has more to do with aesthetics than some would be inclined to believe, and making sure
  ΒScript is pretty is very important to me. I think allowing unicode operators when they exist is good for readability
  and to make ΒScript look more like math, which is kind of the point. Of course, I don't expect people to have these
  symbols on their keyboards, so I will also write a formatter for ΒScript which automatically does these replacements.
  It will also help enforce the formatting rules which i'd like people to follow that won't be possible when the
  linebreak tokens are removed. And talking about aesthetics, I will redo the website, because it is just too ugly.
</p></div><div class="diary_entry"><h1> Unmessing up optional semicolons - 31/10/2020 </h1>
<p>
  the way optional semicolons was implemented was that "if you don't want to put one, a linebreak is fine". This is
  horrible. Don't do this. In all the places linebreaks were allowed in the middle of an expression, i had to check and
  remove them by hand. This happens because to check for meaningless linebreaks in the scanner, i could only look back,
  since the next token wasn't scanned yet. To solve this, i decided to add an extra function in the end of the scanner
  which looks at the token list to check for linebreaks where the next token automatically discards the linebreak, such
  as <span class="code_fragment">)</span>, <span class="code_fragment">]</span>, <span class="code_fragment">}</span> and <span class="code_fragment">else</span>.

<p>
  first of all, i'd like to say i've changed my mind. MM/DD/YYYY is still the worst, but YYYY-MM-DD is better than
  DD/MM/YYYY.
</p>
<p>
  With that out of the way: ΒScript V0.3 is ready! We now have tri-state logic, unicode alternatives for many operators
  and some bug fixes. This update was a lot smaller language-wise, because it also includes a
  <a href="https://github.com/LucasEBSkora/bsfmt">formatter</a>, a
  <a href="https://github.com/LucasEBSkora/bstools">syntax highlighting vs code extension</a> and a redo of this site!
  It was not only the unicode update, but the first major aesthetics update.
</p>
<h1> 0.4: being useful- 2020-01-10 </h1>
<p>
  Let's be honest here. Right now, ΒScript doesn't do anything unique. And it probably will remain like that for a
  while. But 0.4 may start making it actually useful: The update of "explain" statements! "explain" will, well, explain
  how every operation in the following block is executed. For instance,
  <span class="code_fragment">explain ∂(sin(x) ^ 2) / ∂(x) </span> would print out the step-by-step to arrive
  at the result. Besides that, it will include a ΒScript android app, which will include an full interpreter and a
  section to train derivating harder functions.
