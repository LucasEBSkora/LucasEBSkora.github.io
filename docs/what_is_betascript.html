<h1>What is Î’Script?</h1>
<p>
  First of all, the language name is read "betascript", 
  because that is a uppercase Beta, which, incidentally, is identical to a uppercase latin alphabet "B".
</p>
<p>With that established, BScript is a scripting language based around the concept of mathematical functions as variables.
  it is an interpreted, semicolon-terminated, lexically-scoped, OO-supporting language. 
</p>
<p>
  By mathematical functions, we mean functions defined from a subset of R <sup>n</sup> to a subset of R. In order to avoid confusion,
  this documentation will referenced these variables as "functions", and normal programming language functions as routines.
