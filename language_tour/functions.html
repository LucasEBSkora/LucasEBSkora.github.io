<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>
  Here is where ΒScript gets unique: functions defined from a subset of R<sup>n</sup> to a subset of R are a data type. They are declared like normal
  variables with the "let" keyword, but with a catch: you can define a list of parameters after the variable name:
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
let f(x) = x
</p>

<p>
  That 'x' after the variable name creates a special variable of type "Variable" 
  (yes, i know it needs to change. For now, "Variable" is this special type which representes a function parameter, and "variable" is any variable).
  This data type is important later, when actually calling or derivating functions. It can have any valid variable name,
  which means it has to start with '_' or a letter and can contain '_', letters and numbers. Other than these parameter names,
  one may define functions with sums, subtractions, multiplications, divisions and exponentiations, as well as using number literals:
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x) = x<br>
  let g(x, y) = x + y<br>
  let h(x, y, z) = (x*y)^z<br>
  let i(z) = 6*x^2<br>
</p>

<p>
  you can also call these functions, of course. In order to do this, write the variable names, followed by the values you want for each parameter in the same 
  order of the function declaration:
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x, y) = x^y<br>
  print f(2, 3) 
</p>
<p>
  outputs 8, but:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(y, x) = x^y<br>
  print f(2, 3) 
</p>
<p>
  Outputs 9.
</p>
<p>of course, a system able to only create those functions would be almost useless. In order to create more complex functions, one uses function composition:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x, y) = x^y<br>
  let g(x) = f(x, x)<br>
</p>
<p>The way to actually create all logarithmic, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, and inverse hyperbolic functions is actually by using function
  composition on native objects which implement these functions:
</p>.
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x, y) = sin(x) + ln(y)<br>
  print sin(1)
</p>
<p>
  The complete list of functions that are already implemented is:
  <ul>
    <li>abs(x): absolute value of x</li>
    <li>sgn(x): sign of x</li>
    <li>sqrt(x): square root of x</li>
    <li>log(x, b): logarithm of x in base b</li>
    <li>ln(x): natural logarithm of x </li>

    <li>sin(x): sine of x</li>
    <li>cos(x): cosine of x</li>
    <li>tan(x): tangent of x</li>
    <li>sec(x): secant of x</li>
    <li>csc(x): cosecant of x</li>
    <li>ctg(x): cotagent of x</li>

    <li>arcsin(x): inverse sine of x</li>
    <li>arccos(x): inverse cosine of x</li>
    <li>arctan(x): inverse tangent of x</li>
    <li>arcsec(x): inverse secant of x</li>
    <li>arccsc(x): inverse cosecant of x</li>
    <li>arcctg(x): inverse cotagent of x</li>

    <li>sinh(x): hyperbolic sine of x</li>
    <li>cosh(x): hyperbolic cosine of x</li>
    <li>tanh(x): hyperbolic tangent of x</li>
    <li>sech(x): hyperbolic secant of x</li>
    <li>csch(x): hyperbolic cosecant of x</li>
    <li>ctgh(x): hyperbolic cotagent of x</li>

    <li>arsinh(x): inverse hyperbolic sine of x</li>
    <li>arcosh(x): inverse hyperbolic cosine of x</li>
    <li>artanh(x): inverse hyperbolic tangent of x</li>
    <li>arsech(x): inverse hyperbolic secant of x</li>
    <li>arcsch(x): inverse hyperbolic cosecant of x</li>
    <li>arctgh(x): inverse hyperbolic cotagent of x</li>
  </ul>
  We also have the following numeric constants:
  <ul>
  <li>"pi": π</li>
  <li>"e": e</li>
  <li>"infinity": ∞</li>

  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  In some cases, the parameter list after a function name is optional. since Variables end up declared in the local scope, the following code 
  is perfectly valid, even if it is weird:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x) = x^2<br>
  let g(y) = 3*y<br>
  let h = x*y
</p>
<p>
  The main use for this is to allow defining functions with others easier. The following snippet works because of it:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x) = x^2<br>
  let g(y) = 3*y<br>
  let h = f*g
</p>
<p>
  This doesn't work, however, when a new variable needs to be used. If there is a single new variable in a function, one must list all of them, to make
  sure the variable order is as desired.
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x) = x^2<br>
  let g(y) = 3*y<br>
  let h(x,y,z) = f*g*arsinh(z)
</p>

<h2>The '~' operator</h2>
<p>
  ΒScript will always try to keep things as exact as possible. This means that sin(1) doesn't evaluate to 0.8414709848078965, but to sin(1). If you
  want approximate results, you need to use the '~' (or approximation) operator. Since we got into the subject of simplifications, i think it's a good spot
  to clarify something: there are A LOT of missing simplifications. What exists is there to make sure i could leave derivative rules as 
  generic as possible without things printing weirdly. If you want to use something which would depend on a simplification, such as sin(pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2),
  check first.
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  print sin(1) //sin(1)<br>
  print ~sin(1) //0.8414709848078965<br>

</p>

<h2>Comparisons</h2>
<p>
  As i said before, there is a difference between == and === concerning functions. To simply evaluate whether two functions are exactly the same, returning a boolean value, use === (identically equal operator).
  You will never get a false positive, but it is very likely you will get false negatives. in essence, don't really trust the === operator unless you're using it with constant functions (numbers).
  To generate equations, which can be (for now) only used to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions#Intensional_definition">intentionally-defined sets</a>, 
  use ==. You can also generate inequations using &lt;, &gt;, &le; and &ge;.
  For constant functions, these operators will also generate boolean values instead of comparison objects.
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x) = sin^2(x)<br>
  let g(x) = e^x<br>
  let h(x, y) = sin(x)^2 + cos(y)^2<br>
  print h == 1 // false <br>
  print f === g // false<br>
  print f == g // f == g<br>
  print 2.0 == 3.0 // true<br>
  print 2.5 === 3.5 // false<br>
</p>

<h2>derivatives</h2>
<p>
  ΒScript is able not only of evaluating functions, but calculating their partial derivatives of any order. For that, we use derivative expressions:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x) = sin(x)<br>
  print del(f) / del(x) //cos(x)<br>
  print del(f) / del(x, x) //-sin(x)<br>
  print del(f) / del(x, x, x) //-cos(x)<br>
  print del(f) / del(x, x, x, x) //sin(x)<br>
</p>

<p>But, as i said, it calculates <i>partial</i> derivatives:</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x, y) = x^2*y^3<br>
  print del(f) / del(x, y, x) //(6*((y)^(2)))<br>
</p>

<p>>This works for functions with any number of variables, and the result of the derivative expression is another function, which can be evaluated, 
  derivated and used in composition just like any other! Also, for functions defined in a single variable, one can use the apostrophe shorthand
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x) = x^2<br>
  print f' === del(f) / del(x) //prints true;
</p>
