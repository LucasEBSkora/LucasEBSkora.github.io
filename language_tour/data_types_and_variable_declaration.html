<h1>Data types and variable declaration</h1>
<p>
  BScript variables are dynamically-typed, and can be declared with the "let" keyword.
  There are three primitive data types in betascript: <i>functions</i> (numbers are treated as constant functions),
  strings and booleans values. There is also "null", which represents the lack of a value.
  In order to print values, use the "print" keyword (yes, it isn't a standard library function.
  Yes, i know that's weird). 
</p>
<p>
  Unassigned variables receive the value null, but it can be directly assigned.<br>
  Functions are declared using number literals and functions. The next section will explain more about them.<br>
  String literals are declared between quotes.<br>
  The only valid boolean values are true and false.<br>
  Here are some examples:
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  var m = null;<br>
  var n;<br>
  var x = 1.0;<br>
  var string = "i am a string";<br>
  var otherString = string + " but a little longer";<br>
  var y = x + 5;<br>
  print otherString;<br>
</p>
