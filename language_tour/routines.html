<h1>Routines</h1>
<p>
  BScript has routines as first class citizens, and creates them in the lexical scope. In order to declare one, 
  use the keyword "function" followed by its name, parentheses containing a list of parameters, and a block body:
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  function printStuff() {<br>
    &emsp; print "stu" + "ff";<br>
  }<br>
</p>

<p>
  This does mean some weird stuff can be done, like the snippet below. I don't know why you would do it, but it's possible, and really weird:
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  function makeCounter() {<br>
    &emsp; var a = 0;<br><br>
  
    &emsp; function count () {<br>
      &emsp; &emsp; a = a + 1;<br>
      &emsp; return a;<br>
      &emsp; }<br>
      <br>
      &emsp; return count;<br>
  }<br>
  
    var counter = makeCounter();<br>
    print counter();<br>
    print counter();<br>
    <br>
    var counter2 = makeCounter();<br>
    print counter2();<br>
  
</p>

<p> with output:</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
1<br>
2<br>
1<br>
</p>
