<h1>Sets</h1>

<p>ΒScript also allows users to define real sets. More specifically, intervals, roster sets, sets defined as solutions to equations, and sets derived from operations between the three former types.
  It is also able to compare sets for being disjoined with or contained in another, or to check if a particular number belongs to the set. </p>

<h2>Set definitions</h2>
<p>All set definitions can have the <span style="font-family: monospace;">set</span> keyword before them, but it is completely optional. </p>

<h3>Interval definitions</h3>
<p>To define an interval, do exactly as you would when writing an interval! <span style="font-family: monospace;">(</span> is a open left edge, and 
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">)</span> is a open right edge. <span style="font-family: monospace;">[</span> is a
  closed left edge, and <span style="font-family: monospace;">]</span> is a closed right edge. 
  Separate the value of left and right edge with a comma. Note that <span style="font-family: monospace;">infinity</span> is a valid edge.
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let A = set (10, 20];<br>
  let f(x) = 256^x;<br>
  let B = [f(0), f(1));<br>

</p>

<h3>Roster set definitions</h3>
<p>Roster set is a fancy name for "set defined by listing all its components". In order to define them, put the elements in braces separated by commas.   </p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let A = {10, 20, 30, 0, -127, pi, 318};
</p>

<h3>Builder set definitions</h3>

<p>builder sets are sets defined as solutions to equations or equations systems. When betascript is sure that it can find all solutions to a equation, it will
  return a roster set or interval instead of a proper BuilderSet object. For now, this only happens for linear equations. In order to declare them, between braces,
  put a optional list of parameters (which works exactly like the function declaration parameters, it defines the Variables and checks that they actually contain Variables
  when already defined), a <span style="font-family: monospace;">|</span>, them a equation or inequation (two functions to each side of ==, &lt;, &gt;, &le; or &ge;):
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace">
  print {x| x > 5} //prints (5,∞)<br>
  print {|x == 2} //prints { 2 }. Notice that we don't need to specify x because it was declared as a parameter in the previous line, but the '|' is always obligatory
</p>

<h3>Empty set</h3>
<p>the empty set is the set without any elements. it can be used in betascript as <span style="font-family: monospace;">emptySet</span>, empty braces 
  (<span style="font-family: monospace;">{}</span>) or intervals with open edges where the edges are equal (anything of the form (a, a),[a, a) or (a, a]). 
  It has the property of being the third value that is evaluated as false, together with <span style="font-family: monospace;">nil</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">false</span>.
</p>

<h2>Set operations</h2>

<p>betascript supports unions, complements, relative complements and absolute complements as operations that return sets, and it is able to check if two sets 
  are disjoined, if one is contained in the other, or if a number belongs to a set. The "no false positives premise" applies here too.
  When it isn't able to compute one of the first operations to a Interval, Roster Set or Builder Set, 
  it returns a composite set that works just like any other. Every operation has at least a keyword or operator associated with it:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Union has '<span style="font-family: monospace;">union</span>' and '<span style="font-family: monospace;">+</span>';
    </li>
    <li>
      Intersection has '<span style="font-family: monospace;">intersection</span>' and '<span style="font-family: monospace;">*</span>';
    </li>
    <li>
      relative complement has '<span style="font-family: monospace;">-</span>', '<span style="font-family: monospace;">/</span>' and '<span style="font-family: monospace;">\</span>';
    </li>
    <li>
      absolute complement has '<span style="font-family: monospace;">'</span>;
    </li>
    <li>contained in, belongs to and disjoined with use the keywords '<span style="font-family: monospace;">contained</span>', '<span style="font-family: monospace;">belongs</span>' and '<span style="font-family: monospace;">disjoined</span>' (shockingly)</li>;
  </ul>
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} <br><br>

let B = (0, 5) <br><br>

let C = {x| x == 5} <br><br>

print A // prints { 1, 2, 3, 4 } <br>
print B //prints (0,5) <br>
print C //prints { 5 }<br>

print {| x^2 == 2} //prints {x | ((x)^(2)) == 2} : betascript doesn't know how to solve quadratic equations yet <br>

print A contained B //true <br>

print 2.5 belongs A //false <br>

print 2.5 belongs B //true <br>

print A union B //(0,5) <br>
print A intersection B //{ 1, 2, 3, 4 } <br>
print A disjoined C // true <br>

print C' //(-∞,5) ∪ (5,∞) <br>

print A\B //∅ <br>
