<h1>Control flow</h1>
<p>
  BScript supports the classics: C style if/else, while, and for statements.
</p>
<h2>if/else</h2>
<p>
  If the condition inside the "if" parentheses is "truthy", the block following it is executed.
  If not, and there is an "else" statement following it, the block following it is executed.
  "Truthy" basically means "anything but null and false". By the way, boolean operations can be done
  with the "not", "and", and "or" keywords.
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  if (variable == null) {<br>
    &emsp; "no value!";<br>
  } else if (variable < 0) {<br>
    &emsp; print "variable is negative number!"<br>
  } else if (variable == 2 or variable == 3 or variable == 5 or variable == 7) {<br>
    &emsp; print "variable is prime smaller than 10"<br>
  } else print "variable is something else"<br>
</p>

<h2>While</h2>
<p>
  Used for repetitions. While the condition between parentheses after "while" is true, it will keep running the program. 
  The first snippet below prints the integers from 0 to 9. The second one creates an endless loop, and the third one never runs.
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  var i = 0;<br>
  while (i < 10) {<br>
    print i;<br>
    &emsp; i = i + 1; <br>
  }<br><br>
  while (true) {<br>
    &emsp; print "help!";<br>
  }<br><br>

  var v = 0;<br>
  while (v == null) {<br>
    &emsp; print "Undefined!";<br>
  }<br>
</p>

<h2>For</h2>
<p>Syntactic sugar for a very common type of loop. It basically does the same as the first while example, but more compact.</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) print i;
</p>
<p>
  The first parenthesized expression is a variable declaration or assigment, and only runs once, before the first loop. 
  The second expression is equivalent to the while condition, and the third one runs after every loop, but before the second expression
  is evaluated again.
