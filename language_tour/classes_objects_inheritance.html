<h1>Classes, objects and inheritance</h1>
<p>
  Betascript allows the creation of classes with methods, initializers, and single inheritance. 
  Classes are created using the 'class' keyword followed by the class name, and then a block. This block may contain
  method declarations, which are like routine declarations but don't require the keyword (the 'self' paramenter is implicit).
  In methods, it is possible to access the object's fields using 'self'. initializers are declared as methods with the same name as the class,
  and calling the class name will call the initializer, which returns a new instance of the class.
</p>

<p>
  Betascript only supports single inheritance, and it is done by declaring the class with the following sintax:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  class (class name) < (superclass name) {(class declaration)}
</p>
<p>
  superclass methods can be called using the "super" keyword. A class can only have one initializer, and they are not inherited.
</p>
<p>
  The following code sample exemplifies pretty much everything explained here:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  class A {<br>
    &emsp;  method() {<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;   print "a method";<br>
      &emsp; }<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
  class B < A {<br>
    &emsp; method() {<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;   print "B method";<br>
      &emsp;  }<br>
  <br>
  &emsp;  test() {<br>
    &emsp; &emsp;  super.method();<br>
    &emsp;  }<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
  class C < B {<br>
    &emsp;  C(callback) {<br>
      &emsp; &emsp;   this.callback = callback;<br>
      &emsp;   }<br>
  <br>
  &emsp;  callCallback() {<br>
    &emsp; &emsp; this.callback();<br>
    &emsp;  }<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
  function printStuff() {<br>
    &emsp;   print "stu" + "ff";<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
  var thing = C(printStuff);<br>
  <br>
  thing.test();<br>
  thing.method();<br>
  thing.callCallback();<br>
</p>
