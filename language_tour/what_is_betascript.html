<h1>What is ΒScript?</h1>
<p>
  First of all, the language name is read "betascript",because that "Β" is a uppercase Beta, which, incidentally, is
  identical to a uppercase latin alphabet "B".
</p>
<p>With that established, ΒScript is a scripting language based around the concept of mathematical functions as a basic
  data type. it is an interpreted, optionally-semicolon-terminated, lexically-scoped, OO-supporting language.
</p>
<p>
  By mathematical functions, we mean functions defined from a subset of R<sup>n</sup> to a subset of R. In order to
  avoid confusion, this documentation will reference these variables as "functions", and normal programming language
  functions as "routines".
