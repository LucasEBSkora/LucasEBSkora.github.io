<h1>Set operations are also (kinda) hard - 04/07/2020 </h1>
<p>I started to define set classes to represent subsets of R. This wil have many uses in future updates, so I want to do
  it well. Since I want to be able to define many types of sets, I decided that there will be a few different subtypes:
  <ul>
    <li>Intervals, as in, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)">intervals</a>.</li>
    <li>Roster sets, which are created by enumerating their elements, e.g. {1, 10, 52.3, -17}</li>
    <li>Set builders, which are defined by solutions of comparisons, e.g., {x | x == 10 and sin(x) &gt; 10}</li>
    <li>Disjoined unions of sets, which are used when something has parts which can't be simplified to one of the previous. 
      e.g., the union of [-1,0] and [1, 2] is still [-1,0] U [1,2]. In other cases, however, simplifications can be made:
      [-1,0] U {-1, -0.3, 57} = [-1,0] U {57}
    </li>
    <li>the empty set, which is considered a different class because operations with empty sets are normally very straightforward.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Up to this point, everything is fine. The problem is trying to define operations between sets. we need to define how to do unions,
  intersections and complements between all of the above types. This is not such a big problem for complement: we can just have a complement
  method which itselfs check what is the type of the other Set in order to properly compute it. A bigger problem comes from unions and
  intersections: they are comutative! That means that using the tactic above will lead to a lot of hassle. Essentially, for all 3 operations,
  we need to fill out the following table:
  <table >
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Interval</th>
        <th>Roster</th>
        <th>Builder</th>
        <th>Disjoint Union</th>
        <th>Empty</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Interval</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Roster</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Builder</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Disjoint Union</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Empty</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
</p>

  However, there's a catch. Unions and intersections are commutative, which means the table is simetric. I don't have to fill it all the way,
  The upper triangular part is enough. With all that taken into account, i need to think of a data structure to represent these 
  "operation tables" that won't be too hard to extend later...
