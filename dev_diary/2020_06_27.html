<h1>Got to the bridge, can't avoid crossing it anymore - 27/06/2020</h1>
<p> Well, everything i needed to do before actually implementing the functions into the language is ready. By the way, i ended up changing to using negatives as a class,
  because i noticed there was a good way of dealing with other function attributes (namely, parameters, and in a later date domain and codomain) which wouldn't apply to
  negatives. So, now i have to actually discuss how they will work. In order to declare a function, one does something like:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f(x, y, z) = sin(x) + cos(y) + z^3;
</p>
<p>
  Where 'let' is the keyword to declare variables, f is the variable name, and (x, y, z) is the optional parameter list. This list is used in case the user wants to
  defined a function with extra variables that aren't actually necessary (such as f(x) = 0) or to evaluate them in a order other than alphabetic. e.g., if i wanted
  z to be the first parameter, i would be able to declare the function  f(z, y, x). If i wanted to call this function, i could use an expression such as:
</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  print f(2, 10, cos(z));
</p>
<p>
  outputting:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  sin(2) + cos(10) + cos(z)^3
</p>
<p>
  Which is not necessarily what you expected. ΒScript keeps things exact if you don't explicity state you want approximations done, through the approximate
  (~) operator:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  print ~f(2, 10, cos(3));
</p>
<p>
  outputting:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  -0.90005104017
</p>
<p>
  ΒScript is also capable of calculating partial derivatives. For that, use the del() / del() operator. As your teacher probably told you in calculus class,
  this isn't a real division, it's a notation (until he told you it actually was a division of differentials, and, just like in calculus class,
   we might have differentials later):
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  print del(f)/del(x);
</p>
<p>
  outputs:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  cos(x)
</p>
<p>
  Partial derivatives and higher-order derivatives are also supported:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  let f = x^2*y^3;
  print del(f)/del(x, y, x);
</p>
<p>
  outputs:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  6*y^2
</p>
<p>
  When all of these things are implemented, ΒScript V0.1 will be ready! as minor things, i'll change the keywords "var" to "let" and "function" to "routine".
