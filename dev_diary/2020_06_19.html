<h1>Calling functions - 19/06/2020</h1>
<p>In the first entry, I mentioned it would be necessary to change how we evaluate functions in order to continue developing the language.</p>
<p>
  For this, a few changes are still necessary. Currently, I am changing the way functions are evaluated. Before, evaluating a function would be done
  by passing a Map &lt; String, double &gt;, but since ΒScript doesn't even have the type double, that doesn't make any sense. therefore,
  we now evaluate them by passing a Map &lt; String, BSFunction &gt;, which has a second benefit: we know can do function composition properly!
  Before, things like
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  f = sin(x); <br>
  g = f(x^2) <br>
</p>
<p>
  wouldn't work. now, that's perfectly valid! Besides, calling a function like that will not perform simplifications. if we had, for example
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  f = sin(x); <br>
  g = f(2) <br>
</p>
<p>
  g would evaluate to sin(2), not to 0.909... <br>
  if we wanted it to evaluate to its approximation, we can use the approx getter, which, in the language, will translate to the '~' operator.
  In ΒScript, one would write:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
  g = ~sin(2)
</p>
<p>
  to get 0.909...
