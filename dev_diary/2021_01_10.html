<h1> ΒScript V0.3: "the unicode update" - 2020-01-10 </h1>
<p>
  first of all, i'd like to say i've changed my mind. MM/DD/YYYY is still the worst, but YYYY-MM-DD is better than
  DD/MM/YYYY.
</p>
<p>
  With that out of the way: ΒScript V0.3 is ready! We now have tri-state logic, unicode alternatives for many operators
  and some bug fixes. This update was a lot smaller language-wise, because it also includes a
  <a href="https://github.com/LucasEBSkora/bsfmt">formatter</a>, a
  <a href="https://github.com/LucasEBSkora/bstools">syntax highlighting vs code extension</a> and a redo of this site!
  It was not only the unicode update, but the first major aesthetics update.
</p>
<h1> 0.4: being useful- 2020-01-10 </h1>
<p>
  Let's be honest here. Right now, ΒScript doesn't do anything unique. And it probably will remain like that for a
  while. But 0.4 may start making it actually useful: The update of "explain" statements! "explain" will, well, explain
  how every operation in the following block is executed. For instance,
  <span class="code_fragment">explain ∂(sin(x) ^ 2) / ∂(x) </span> would print out the step-by-step to arrive
  at the result. Besides that, it will include a ΒScript android app, which will include an full interpreter and a
  section to train derivating harder functions.
