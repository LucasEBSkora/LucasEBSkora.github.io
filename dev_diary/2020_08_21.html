<h1> My beautiful baby boy - 21/08/2020</h1>
<p>
  Today was one of the first days I could actually use my comparison class to solve something. It was very simple, but
  just seeing a program I created be able to transform an inequation into a solution set was something amazing to feel.
  The first time I was able to see the output of <span class="code_fragment">print del(sin) / del(x);</span>
  was definitely the best day of the year; and today wasn't so good, but automating set operations made it a little
  better.
