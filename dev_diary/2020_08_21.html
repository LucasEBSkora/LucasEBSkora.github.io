<h1> My beautiful baby boy - 21/08/2020</h1>
<p>
  Today was one of the first days i could actually use my comparison class to solve something. It was very simple, but just seeing
  a program i created be able to transform an inequation into a solution set was something amazing to feel. The first time i was able
  to see the output of <span style="font-family: monospace;">print del(sin) / del(x);</span>  was definitely the best day of the year;
  and today wasn't so good, but automating set operations made it a little better.
