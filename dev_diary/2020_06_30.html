<h1>Road to 0.2 - 30/06/2020</h1>
<p>Yesterday I finished v0.1, but that doesn't mean I'll take a break! I'm thinking about what I want to call ΒScript v0.2. The primary focus
  now will be to develop the things I feel will be necessary for making the twitter version of ΒScript (yes, thats a thing). Basically a bot which
  will answer to tweets with ΒScript code with their output. For that, I will turn off defining and using routines and loops (don't want anyone killing
  my bot with a while(true)). Other than that, I want to try to make error handling better, since I already noticed it doesn't show some of them properly.
  As for actual new features, I'm planning the creation of "comparison expressions", which are basically equations and inequalities, and the ability to create
  subsets of R, which will come in handy with later updates.
